# RockPaperScissor
This is a Rock Paper Scissor Game(User v/s Computer). As all of us had already played this game in childhood and know the rules but still if you want to recall the rules and instructions are listed to read before you start to play the game. 
Everytime you play your turn the game lists your and computer's scores so, you can see who is leading and how much chances you have more. 
The player to reach the score of 5 initially wins the game.
Thank you!
